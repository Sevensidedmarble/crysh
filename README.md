# crysh

A Unix shell written in Crystal.

## Installation

Crysh currently needs to be built from source. To do that, you must install [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Sevensidedmarble/crysh.git && cd crysh`

2. Install dependencies: `crystal deps`

3. Build: `crystal build src/crysh.cr`

4. Run with `./crysh`

## Usage

Build the program from source, then run it. Crysh can be used like any other unix shell.

## Development

Some planned changes are noted in the source code via TODO comments. Feel free to open a pull request or issue if you have an idea.

I've collected some very helpful resources about programming shells in the wiki, [available here.](https://github.com/Sevensidedmarble/crysh/wiki/Important-Links-for-Making-Shells)
